Shadowtime
==========

This is a program that can calculate and plot the expected amount of annual shadow flicker that can be 
expected in the vicinity of a wind turbine of a certain size given the latitude.

The calculations is based on the assumption that earth moves in a circular orbit around the sun, that 
the axial tilt is a fixed number and that the earth surface is a perfect sphere. Never-the-less I don't
see why these assumptions shouln't bee sufficient for most purposes. 

Note that I am not an expert on this field. So no guarantees :).
