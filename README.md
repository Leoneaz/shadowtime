Shadowtime
==========

Shadowtime is a program that can calculate and plot the expected annual amount of shadow flicker that can be 
expected in the vicinity of a wind turbine of a certain size given the latitude.

Many governements require that such a computaion is done and that an entrepreneur wanting to raise a turbine
shows that a certain threashold number of hours isn't exceeded for the houses in the vicinity of the wind turbine.

## Modeling assumptions

1. The wind turbine is modeled as a solid cylinder.
2. Earth is assumed to move in a circular orbit around the sun.
3. Earth axial tilt is a fixed number and that the earth surface is a perfect sphere. 
4. No local topography is accounted for. Earth is modeled as a perfect sphere. 
5. The sun is assumed to always shine. 

Never-the-less I don't see why these assumptions wouldn't bee sufficient for many simple cases. For more complicated
cases there exists commercial codes (e.g., WindPro) that can also output detailed reports.  

## Disclaimber
I am not at all an expert on this field. So no guarantees :).
